# Holberton School - Variables, If, Else, While

This repository contains my solutions for the **Variables, If, Else, While** project at Holberton School. The exercises focus on learning how to work with variables, control flow statements (`if`, `else`, `while`, `do/while`), and printing output in C.

## Files and Exercises

| `1-last_digit.c` | Prints the last digit of a randomly generated number. |
| `2-print_alphabet.c` | Prints the alphabet in lowercase using a loop. |
| `3-print_alphabets.c` | Prints the alphabet in lowercase and uppercase using a loop. |
| `4-print_alphabt.c` | Prints the sign of a number (`+`, `0`, `-`). |
| `5-more_numbers.c` | Prints numbers from 0 to 14 ten times. |
| `6-print_numberz.c` | Draws a straight line using the `_` character. |
| `7-print_tebahpla.c` | Prints the alphabet in reverse (z to a). |
| `8-print_base16.c` | Prints all numbers of base 16 in lowercase (0–9, a–f). |
